# Vault Status — AI Employee Skill

Quick snapshot of the current state of all vault folders.

## Instructions

1. Count files in each folder (exclude `.gitkeep`):
   - `AI_Employee_Vault/Inbox/`
   - `AI_Employee_Vault/Needs_Action/`
   - `AI_Employee_Vault/Pending_Approval/`
   - `AI_Employee_Vault/Approved/`
   - `AI_Employee_Vault/Plans/`
   - `AI_Employee_Vault/Done/`
   - `AI_Employee_Vault/Logs/`
2. List the filenames in `Needs_Action/` and `Pending_Approval/` (these need attention).
3. Read `AI_Employee_Vault/Dashboard.md` and note if it is up to date.
4. Print a clean summary table.

## Output
